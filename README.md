bankswitch
=====

This project is based on Stegen Hugg's bankswitch example available at [8bitworkstop](https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.7.0/?file=bankswitch.c&platform=nes).

Problems:
 - Some devices, area not able to run this demo. Although, same device is able to run similar ROMs with the same mapper (Like SMB3);
 - Not able to use Bank 2 on 8000, demo crashs on fceux.

Hypothesis: Mighy be something awkward on the final rom Packed.
